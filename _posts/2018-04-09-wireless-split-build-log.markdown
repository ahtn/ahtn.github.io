This is a rebuild of my old board, you can see the [original build log for with
the case and wiring here](https://imgur.com/a/obCG2). If you are interested
in the files for the case, you can [find them here](https://github.com/ahtn/jemini_layered_acrylic_case). I should probably rework the case to have a hole for the USB
port and better place to position the wireless controller.  When I originally
made this board, I didn't have a way to support USB in the firmware with the
controller I was using in my early prototypes, so that's why there's no USB
port in this version of the case.

At this point I had two wireless modules wired up together, I could start
testing the wireless functionality. To do this I needed to write a basic layout
and assign the device `ID` to each controller. Using the keyplus flasher, you
can generate the RF key and set the device ID using the "Device and RF" tab
from the drop down menu. You only need to do this once, then future updates
will only need to provide your layout file. An example layout file is
given below that defines the two devices and shows how the split devices
are connected. You can
[get latest version of the flasher here](https://github.com/ahtn/keyplus/releases).
You can get more information and examples of the [layout format here](
https://github.com/ahtn/keyplus/tree/master/layouts).

I could then test that the wireless communication was working by shorting the
row and column pins together to generate key presses.

After reassembling the boards, I notice that some of the keys on the left half
were chattering. This is probably because my soldering on the left half was
pretty janky, so the scanning algorithm didn't wait long enough for signal
to stabilise. To fix that I changed the debounce settings to wait longer. I
could probably have used lower values, but since this case doesn't expose
the USB port externally, I just choose very conservative values to avoid
disassembling the case every time I wanted to change it. I strongly recommend
having an exposed USB port, and it also allows you to use the board as a
wireless receiver for other devices.

The right side seemed to be work fine with the default values, so I just left
it with the defaults values.

```yaml
    scan_mode:
      # ...
      debounce:
        # After an up/down event is generated, the keyboard
        # will wait this long before accepting the next
        # key up/down event (in ms)
        debounce_time_press: 5 # default 5
        debounce_time_release: 5 # default 5

        # switch must stay pressed/relased this long
        # before a key down/up event is generated (in ms)
        trigger_time_press: 5 # default 1
        trigger_time_release: 5 # default 3

        # amount of time between scanning rows (in Âµs)
        parasitic_discharge_delay_idle: 30.0 # default 2.0
        parasitic_discharge_delay_debouncing: 30.0 # default 10.0
```

After I got everything working, I merged the settings into my main layout file,
you can [see it here](https://github.com/ahtn/keyplus/blob/75c7571233ccc901496a8239a724ca65ee7cd193/layouts/basic_split_test.yaml). This way I can use any of my split
keyboards as a wireless receiver for any of the others. It is important to
remember that the device acting as the wireless receiver determines what
keypress will be generated. Most of the device settings (RF, matrix, etc) are
stored on the device, but the layout used is determined by the receiver. So
if you wanted you could store different layouts on each device, and the layout
used would be determined by which device is acting as the receiver.
